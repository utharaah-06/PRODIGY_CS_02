# PRODIGY_CS_02 - Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## Description
This project implements a simple image encryption and decryption tool using **pixel manipulation**.  
Each pixel's RGB values are modified using a numeric **encryption key**, making the image unreadable until decrypted with the same key.  
This demonstrates basic image processing and is suitable for beginner-level cybersecurity or programming tasks.

## Features
- Encrypt images using a numeric key  
- Decrypt images using the same key  
- Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG images  
- Simple and easy-to-understand pixel manipulation  
- Tested on Kali Linux  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Pillow (`PIL`) library for image handling  

pip3 install pillow
python3 image_encrypt_decrypt.py
Pixel Manipulation Image Encryption
1. Encrypt Image
2. Decrypt Image
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 1
Enter encryption key (number): 50
Enter input image name (with extension): testpixel.jpeg

Encrypted image will be saved as encrypted_image.png
Decrypted image will be saved as decrypted_image.png
